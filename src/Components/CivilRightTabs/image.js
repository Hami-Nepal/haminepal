      "From the Nepalgunj District, a group of 14 people, mostly women, came in Kathmandu. They walked the entire distance, which was about 500 kilometers. On September 14, 2021, the group began their long march for justice. After being denied justice by local authorities, the group of locals from Banke district in Lumbini Province decided to march on foot to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, to bring justice to the people. Their only demand is that the death of Nakunni Dhobi and the disappearance of Nirmala Kurmi be investigated fairly. One of the women was murdered, while the other has been missing since 2010. On July 20, 2021, Nakunni Dhobi was discovered dead at her house in Janaki Rural Municipality, Banke District, under dubious circumstances. Hami Nepal, as soon as the news flashed, went insearch of the group with the sole purpose of their medical safety and protection in whilist their stay in Kathmandu. Hami Nepal assisted the group while they protested in Maitighar. The team checked their Blood Pressure time and again and ensured that they faced no formal or informal problems",

      "Language became one mere problem as there were difficulties faced in the first day while communicating. This didnâ€™t became a issue when two of our volunteers, Mr Sandeep Sharma and Jyoti Sapkota stepped in as they had a better understandingof the language and culture they belong. Besides this, it was quite challenging for their voice to be heard in the concerned authorities. It took few days for them to get media attention and to interact with the government which was not cooperative.  ",
    results:
      "The Government finally took their statements into consideration and ordered a special investigation.",

    detail: `While Nepal was going through COVID crisis and infection rate was high, the oldest and the most reputed Tribhuvan University was compelling its students across the country to take the exams in a physical setting. Hami Nepal team were assisting students in their protest against the TU's decision to conduct physical exams during a difficult epidemic period. TU refused to accept that the exams had been run in an unmanaged manner, with congestion in the exam centers, resulting in a high virus transmission rate, endangering their own and their family members' lives.
    On account of this, Hami Nepal officially filed a writ against Tribhuvan University (TU), Cabinet of Ministers and Education Ministry in Supreme Court on 13th August, 2021 for conducting physical exams during the pandemic without adhering to health standards, putting students, their families, and the entire community at risk, and maybe initiating the 3rd wave. Hami Nepal demanded to use alternative methods of conducting academic tests rather than canceling them, placing every student's life in jeopardy. 
    When the students asked for assistance, Hami Nepal Team did everything they could to assist them.

    challenges: `Hami Nepal had to go through a lot of legal procedures for the fliling of the case and had to collect evidences inorder to make the case strong. Additional to this, Hami Nepal also faced a lot of backlashes from students of other boards besides TU. The students from other board were having similar issues and had the concerns that their voice should also be heard. On the day of the protest, Team Hami Nepal was ready infront of the office of the controller of the examinations to simply look after the protestors and students. Volunteers and Students who were under the scorching sun had their temperature checked time and again for safety.`,
    results: `However at final, the Writ filled6 in the court did not yield big difference in the system. After discussions with all authorities, the judge decided that the examination would be the same as the TU had done previously but under health and safety protocols.`,
